5) Browse to the wildcat folder within the demo folder
6) Click [Next] button
7) Click [Finish] button (if you are prompted to change perspective, click OK)
8) Select [Window -> Show View -> Ant] menu item
Drag "build.xml" file from the [Package Explorer] in the wildcat project into the [Ant] view.
(Ensure you refresh the eclipse project after running any of the ANT targets)
    - compileReports - compiles any jrxml reports in your source path
    - deprecationReport - produces a report of deprecated attributes 
                          present in the skyve metadata
    - generateDefaultQueries - creates generatedQueries.xml, a set of default
                               queries for a module
    - generateDomain - validates all skyve metadata and generates the java domain classes
    - generateEditView - creates wildcat/generateEdit.xml for a document

Edit demo/wildcat/javaee/wildcat.properties,
find the line SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080 (line 26) and change the port to match.
Restart the server (kill the command prompt running run.bat and then restart run.bat)
and hit http://localhost:XXXX/wildcat/ in a browser where XXXX is the new port set.
